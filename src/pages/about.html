                <h3 data-i18n="about.manifesto.importance.title">The Importance of Notes in OpenStreetMap</h3>
                <p data-i18n="about.manifesto.importance.p1">
                    OpenStreetMap Notes are a fundamental mechanism for community collaboration and quality improvement.
                    They serve as a bridge between mappers and the real world, allowing anyone to report issues,
                    suggest improvements, or request new features directly on the map.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.manifesto.importance.p2">
                    Notes represent the collective effort of thousands of contributors working together to improve
                    the map's accuracy and completeness. Each note tells a story—a missing road, an incorrect name,
                    a new business, or a mapping error that needs correction.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.manifesto.importance.p3">
                    Notes help keep the map alive and up-to-date. They enable users who don't know how to map to report
                    discrepancies between what they see on the street and what appears on the map. Mappers then take
                    these reports to provide feedback to the map, improving it according to what users describe. This
                    creates a continuous feedback loop that ensures the map reflects the real world as accurately as possible.

                <h3 data-i18n="about.history.title">Project History</h3>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p1">
                    This project began in 2020, during the pandemic, when Andrés Gómez started reviewing notes in Colombia,
                    where there was no information on how to resolve them, but there were many.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p2">
                    In 2021, he began inviting others to participate in note resolution. First for Bogotá, then thanks to
                    rustiruz, they expanded to resolve notes throughout Colombia, and that's how they came to invite people
                    to resolve notes at the Latin America level.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p3">
                    Rustiruz coined the term "notathon" as an activity where people gather to resolve notes. Since then,
                    notathons have been held in several Latin American countries, and people who resolve notes have been
                    brought together in a <a href="https://t.me/osm_notes_latam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a> where they support each other.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p4">
                    These notathons have allowed the Latam community to reconsolidate, reaching the point of resuming
                    State of the Map Latam events.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p5">
                    Returning to notes, the lack of tools for note resolution has led to requests for many applications
                    to make changes for notes, from including the app name and version, to including specific functionality
                    (fediphoto, damn). However, in terms of resolution, the tools are limited: they show the location of
                    notes (notesViewer), the number of open or closed notes (HDYC), but nothing more. Analysis is scarce,
                    like the notes heatmap app.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p6">
                    On the other hand, notes were added after implementing OSM API 0.6, and their functionality is very limited.
                    Querying a user's notes is tedious, and those of a country are only possible with Pascal Neis's resultMaps,
                    but its analysis is limited.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p7">
                    Additionally, there was a desire to recognize the great notes resolvers of Latam, and that's how the use
                    of the planet dump began. Gradually, the idea matured of having a notes contribution profile similar to HDYC,
                    and that's when research began on API queries for updated data.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p8">
                    That was the Eureka moment, and a mechanism was imagined to download the history and then keep it updated.
                    The first part was in bash, which downloaded the history. It was his friend José Luis Cerón who provided
                    architecture techniques and advised continuing in bash, given how advanced the project was.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p9">
                    Progress continued, but there was a blocker: processing the Planet XML is challenging, and several tools
                    crashed. Years later, his friend José Luis showed him Cursor IDE and how to develop things, where he began
                    practicing with GeoGame, a project that will be resumed once this viewer is stable.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p10">
                    Thanks to AI and many prompts, the proposal was made not to use XML tools, but rather AWK, a robust command
                    with many years of experience. That's how it was possible to process all notes without problems and move
                    forward with the project in late 2025.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p11">
                    Thanks to AI, the code has become more robust, correcting hundreds of errors, including unit tests, integration
                    tests, GitHub Actions, dividing the code into multiple repositories, improving SQL, separating the ingestion
                    part from the analytics part, as well as factoring the common part into commons. Then creating a repo for the
                    visualization part that hadn't been thought of until then, also extracting the WMS part, and new projects emerged
                    like Data, to keep data in another place that can even be used by an AI for context, also the API project to
                    offer more functionality than the OSM API offers including ML, and finally monitoring to understand how all
                    these pieces work.
                </p>
                <p data-i18n="about.history.p12">
                    AI in 2025 accelerated the process and has been a learning experience, as AI sometimes hallucinates, and that's
                    why it must be given good context to focus it. That's why all these repos are full of documentation, so that
                    any future improvement is documented, and any AI can improve the code.

                <p data-i18n="about.dataOrigins.p1">All data displayed in this viewer originates from <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong>, including both cartographic data and notes data. The cartographic information is used for geographic visualization and mapping, while the notes data provides the statistics and analytics shown throughout the application.</p>
                <p data-i18n="about.dataOrigins.p2">To improve the accuracy of maritime zones representation, data from <a href="https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marine Regions</a> was used as a reference. This allowed us to enhance the maritime boundaries and zones when attempting to replicate the information from that portal using OSM data, ensuring better alignment with recognized maritime boundaries and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs).</p>
