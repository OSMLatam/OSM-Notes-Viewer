# OSM OAuth Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your OAuth credentials
# Get your credentials from: https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/{username}/oauth_clients

# OSM OAuth Client ID (public, can be in frontend code)
# Required for note actions: comment, close, reopen
VITE_OSM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here

# OSM OAuth Client Secret (PRIVATE - NEVER commit this!)
# NOTE: For public client flow (frontend-only), this is NOT needed
# Only needed if you implement server-side token exchange
# If you need it, store it here but NEVER commit this file
VITE_OSM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Note: For production, set these as environment variables in your hosting platform
# (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) instead of using .env file
