3. âœ… Removed unused duplicate (`src/config/api-config.js`)
4. âœ… Removed empty `src/config/` directory
5. Document matches codebase (all references point to `config/api-config.js`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… Only one `api-config.js` file exists (`config/api-config.js`)
- âœ… All imports reference the correct file
- âœ… No broken references
- âœ… No linting errors

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Complete all P0 tasks
- This ensures a solid foundation before adding features

### Phase 2: Quality (Week 2)
- Complete P1 tasks 4 and 6 (Testing and Accessibility)
- Ensures code quality and compliance

### Phase 3: Features (Week 3-4)
- Complete P1 task 5 (Core Features)
- Complete P2 tasks 7-10 (Build, Pagination, Mobile, Skeletons)

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 5+)
- Complete P3 tasks as time permits
- Add final touches and optimizations

## Tracking Progress

Use GitHub Projects or Issues to track:
- [ ] Task status (Not Started, In Progress, Done)
- [ ] Time spent
- [ ] Blockers
- [ ] Dependencies

---

## Notes

- Prioritize P0 tasks first - they block production readiness
- Testing (Task 4) should be done incrementally alongside development
- Core features (Task 5) can be split into separate PRs per feature
- Some tasks may be done in parallel if no dependencies

---

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality:** Test coverage > 70%
- **Performance:** Load time < 2s on 3G
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliant
- **User Experience:** All high-priority features working
- **Maintainability:** Clear structure, documented
